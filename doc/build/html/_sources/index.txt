Welcome to MurCSS documentation!
===========================================

| A Tool for Standardized Evaluation of Decadal Hindcast Systems
| 
| The tool calculates the Mean Squared Error Skill Score (MSESS) its decomposition (Correlation + Conditional Bi as) and the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS) as proposed by Goddard et al. [2013]. The MSESS of both models and the MSESS "between" the two models (model versions) are calculated for different leadtimes. The CRPSS is calculated for both models defined by the input parameters. 

This is only the API documentation. If you need more information about how tool works please refer to these pages:
